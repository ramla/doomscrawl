# Weekly Report 1

- Coded the base game onto which generate dungeons. Probably focused too much on visualisation.
- Learned how the Bowyer-Watkins algorithm works, sketched a visualisation plan, did not yet implement the algorithm or its visualisation.
- Next I think I need to get familiar with poetry
- The most difficult thing this week was finding the complete set of objectives for the deadline in the material, which is also why this weekly report is turned in late.
- Spent around 17h all in all getting started
